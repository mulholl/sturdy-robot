Things to consider:
	Function to give command line priority
	Function to give file priority
	Function to give equal priority

	Default values

	Read in multiple arguments for the same option

	Specify a required number of arguments (minimum, maximum, exact?)
	Argument-free options

	Options to be hidden from the help menu?
	Options to be specified only in the file

	Deal with options that have the following argument types: int, unsigned int, double, long, string, vectors of these types, matrices

	Deal with cases where the same option is specified multiple times (probably throw an exception and quit)
	Deal with cases where an option is not recognised
